# Box-fans format

We have developed a template in Excel format to calculate prices of some of our products. It has this columns as layout:

- Type
- Size
- Motor type
- Inlet
- Power Switch
- Pressure Switch
- Roof
- Outlet Rain prot.
- VFD
- Filter
- Double Skin Panels

Problem is, our customers just send the quotation as they want, no matter how hard we tell them to use the template. Since it seems that there is no easy solution for this, we came up creating a tool to kind of translate their quotations to our template.

We used dictionaries to map some specific keywords in the text and get the real component they need.

After getting the result, an Excel file is created with the specific template.
